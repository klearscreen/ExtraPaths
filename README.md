# ExtraPaths

This pack has some paths that I didn't find in TacO, ReActif or Tekkit's Guides.

It has:
- [Passiflora farming path](README.md#passiflora-farming)
- [Orichalcum farming path](README.md#orichalcum-farming)
- [Verdant Brink path from floor to Wyvern Matriarch](README.md#pact-encampment-waypoint-to-wyvern-matriarch)
- [Verdant Brink night bosses icons in the map](README.md#verdant-brink-night-bosses-icons)
- [Verdant Brink paths between night bosses](README.md#verdant-brink-night-bosses-paths)
- [Easy rewards for two daily challanges](README.md#easy-rewards)

## Passiflora farming

This was heavily inspired by Tekkit's guide. I made it because I had to farm chef levels and didn't want to think hard.

It appears only in Southsun Cove.

## Orichalcum farming

Also heavily inspired by Tekkit's guide. It requires Path of Fire and the Spinger and Skimmer mounts.

This was taken directly from [Omnicron's post](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/topic/38543-rich-orichalcum-node-locations/).

It follows these waypoints:
```
[&BLsKAAA=]
[&BEAKAAA=]
[&BJMKAAA=]
[&BJEKAAA=]
[&BNwKAAA=]
[&BHcKAAA=]
[&BMEKAAA=]
[&BEoKAAA=]
Spearmarshal's Plea (closest waypoint is [&BHQKAAA=])
[&BEMLAAA=]
```

## Pact Encampment Waypoint to Wyvern Matriarch

A very kind soul told me I was stupid for doing Rally Point events and said I could just go from the Pact Encampment Waypoint to the Wyvern Matriarch, then left and I had to Google.

This path goes from `[&BAgIAAA=]` to Wyvern Matriarch by climbing the vine in the middle of the map.

It was made with fully upgraded Springer and Glider, so I don't know if they're mandatory.

## Verdant Brink night bosses icons

I made this to help me coordinate with randos. They only shows up in the map.

It becomes reduntant with the following item.

## Verdant Brink night bosses paths

I would still get lost with the map icons, so I made paths to help me go from one boss to another. They only show up in the terrain/main screen.

Fully upgraded mounts could be mandatory, and some paths require a fully upgraded Glider.

It has:
```
Wyvern Matriarch to/from Wyvern Patriarch
Wyvern Matriarch to/from frogs Cotoni and Huetzi
Wyvern Matriarch to/from Axemaster Gwyllion
Wyvern Patriarch to/from frogs Cotoni and Huetzi
Axemaster Gwyllion to/from the tetrad of Mordrem champions
```

## Easy Rewards

Currently it only shows how to use the exit to enter the Magellan's Memento minidungeon, and how to use a Springer for the Wall Breach Blitz jumping puzzle.
